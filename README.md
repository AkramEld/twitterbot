# Twitter Python Bot
This bot allows you to quickly search through users on twitter and stores names with specific requirements that you set your self(followers/tweets etc). It also lists the users info as it searches!

Before you use the bot, you must update the logincredentials file with your own
information. You can do so by first creating a twitter app here: https://apps.twitter.com/app/
